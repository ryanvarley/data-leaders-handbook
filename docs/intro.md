# Data Leaders Handbook

Welcome to the Data Leaders Handbook. This is intended to be a place I can share resources that Intend to grow and evolve over time unlike the main blog. I also welcome suggestiongs and pull requests (see the [github](https://github.com/ryanvarley/data-leaders-handbook)). While the intended audience is leaders in data fields like Data Science, Data Engineering and Data Analytics the content should be very relevant to engineering leaders and managers and similar roles.

Content will still be written for the main blog, [Data Leadership](https://blog.ryanvarley.com/p/pydata-get-started-with-python-async-in-25-minutes-talk)  and you will find more fully fleshed posts there.

For now we only have 1:1 questions here but I have plenty more to add in future including Interview questions, skip level questions and information around running effective 1:1s, retros etc. The best way to get updates is to subscribe to the main blog.
