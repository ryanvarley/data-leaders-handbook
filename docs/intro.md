# Data Leaders Handbook

Welcome to the Data Leaders Handbook. This is a place I can share resources that I intend to grow and evolve over time. I also welcome suggestions and pull requests (see the [github repo](https://github.com/ryanvarley/data-leaders-handbook)). While the intended audience is leaders in data fields like Data Science, Data Engineering and Data Analytics the content should be very relevant to engineering leaders and managers and similar roles.

For now this just contains 1:1 questions but I have plenty more to add in future including questions for interviews, skip levels and feedback. The best way to get updates is to subscribe to the main blog [Data Leadership](https://blog.ryanvarley.com/p/pydata-get-started-with-python-async-in-25-minutes-talk).
