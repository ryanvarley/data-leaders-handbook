# Adapting process

The most important thing to realise is you do need to adapt your process to work for remote! The ceromonies and way of working in person dont all translate well to being remote. The best way to acomindate this is the retrospecitve. Ensure you are thinking about what is working and what is not and make changes.

In particular remote really thrives on asyncrnous communication. Allowing people to work more flexibly and maximise their time in uninterupted flow states.

Ill cover some of the main changes we made next.

## standups / updates

In an office, where everyone is often working the same hours a daily standup makes more sense. Remotely you will likely have people in more time zones, people are working alot more flexibly, and a stand-up becomes a rigid time that may not work for everyone.

## Getting facetime

## Pairing

## meetings

- Contry to convential advice, in remote teams its super important to get some social time with colleagues. The first 5 minutes or so of many meetings dedicated to this is important. It doesnt have to be a hard rule, but i advise avoiding imeplemnting hard rules to rule this out like you may do in person.

## slack
