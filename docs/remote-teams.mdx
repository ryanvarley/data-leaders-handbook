# Adapting process

## Getting facetime

## Pairing

## meetings

- Contry to convential advice, in remote teams its super important to get some social time with colleagues. The first 5 minutes or so of many meetings dedicated to this is important. It doesnt have to be a hard rule, but i advise avoiding imeplemnting hard rules to rule this out like you may do in person.
