# Interview Questions

<img src={FeatureImg} width="400"/>

This is my list of interview questions you can ask candidates in your hiring process. 

Note that this doesn't show my full interview process, more on that another time.

I have added commentary to help you understand my thoughts on them, what they are trying to achieve, and how well they work. While the wording of questions is often deliberate, I don't always strictly adhere to it.

I have given my indication of how much I like a question with stars ★ from 0-3. I don't list bad questions here (unless they are untested and I'm not sure yet), so even 0 stars is good.

Very few of these questions are intended to be asked in isolation. They start a conversation and should be followed up. A follow up is generally a gentle "why?" e.g. "Thats interesting, did you try x?" "how did you solve for y?", "I have foudn that with standups too, but as a remote team how did you get the team facetime?"

## Introduction / phone screen Questions

### Based on your own research and previous conversations can you tell me what you think [Company] does? ★

Have they researched the company at all? Even spent 5 minutes on the website? I want people who care about the role. they dont have to be the companies main evalngelist but they should have spent some time looking into the job they will spend the majortiy of their waking time at.

### What was interesting at [Company] and the job? ★

Better variation on why they want this job. Generally I mostly want enthusiasm for the role, it should match what they are looking for and how they want to progress. The values and ways of working we demonstrated in the job ad should be attractive. Enthusiam for the company mission is always good, ut company dependent how much that matters.

### What did you do to prepare for this interview?

Personally I dont use this. But can be a chance for candidates to show they care. e.g. a nervous candidate early on telling you how they prepared a lot may change your perception and give them more of a chance. I prefer the two above.

### Why are you looking to leave your current role?

Standard questions. You are looking for red flags and that their goals align with what you can offer. For example if they were applying for a manager role but looking for an opportunity to be a C level within 2 years and this is very unlikely to be available at your company, then you should know that and you should let them know that (this has happened!).

### Can you give me a 5 minute summary of your work experience to date?

Whilst their CV should have most of this, having them explain it leader to much more natural conversation. 5 minutes is a good time. You should cut them off if they go too much over.

## Testing competence

Questions in this section are mutli-part. As follow ups are essential. Competence is about deep understanding. Bad competence questions allow candidates to sail through with surface knowledge. 

### What project have you worked on that you're most proud of and why? ★★

The question tests competence and requires many follow ups. Its probably 15-20m and a key part of my hiring manager interview (after phone screen). I say "proud of" as they should have had deep involvement, and still remember the details. The importance of the question however is really in the follow ups 

{/* see advice on rebel / previous posts */}

#### Why did you use X method?
Common asked to data scientists taking about a machine learning project. COPY INFO 

#### How does X method work?
I dont expect mathmatical derivations but they should have an idea of how it works. I sometimes describe this like a racing car driver and the engineers who build the car. Im expect them to be the driver, with a deep understanding of how it behaves and hoe to use it, but not the ins and outs of how it works.

#### What lessons did you learn from this project, is there anything you would do differently in future?

I prefer this phrasing as its more forward looking. I dislike phrasing like "what would you do different if you started again" as it focuses more on decisions you would make differently with more complete knowledge rather than lessons you will take with you to future projects. 

#### Speed of work vs quality, in a spectrum, where do you like to be?

Either extreme is generally bad but im looking for rather than a rigid view there view is fleixble and dependent on circumstances. 

### Case study?

The case study is an essential part of my process on testing competence in the role. It is however, much more than a question and will be covered in its own page at a later date.

## Cultural fit

### What ceremonies and processes does your team do, which do you value or not? ★

The reasons are what your looking for. I really value retrospectives and I've had good candidates say they didn't. When i asked why they explained how their current company runs them and the issues - they have terrible retrospectives! They showed cultral fit in their reasoning by showing what they valued, not the initial answer.

### How would you interview [the role you are applying for]? What would be important for you? ★★

Good for managers and seniors ICs and above. OK for mid-levels, not very useful for juniors. It's a great way of drawing out their values, but also how they think about things. 


### What size team do you like working in?

Generally I have worked in startups with small teams. So if someone like big teams with lots of support then they probably aren't a match. Its mostly trying to figure them out and draw ot their experience. 

### What is your preferred working style? How do you prefer to be managed?

I am generally looking for self starters who can work independently so it is testing a speicific value. However this also offer an opportunity for candidates to volunteer some red flags.

### What are you looking for in a role? ★

Standard question but great to ask. Does what they are looking for align with what you can offer? Tell them the ways it does and doesnt. Everyone appreciates honesty here and there no advantage to tricking them into the role if it is a bad fit.

## Skills fit

### Types of data scientists, what are you? ★

{/* add image of pyramid */}

"If you imagine a pyramid with the top corner being data analytics, the bottom left data engineeering and the bottom right machine learning, where would you place yourself?" For an example if you are just interested in machine learning you'd be right in the corner, or you could be halfway between two."

This sounds like a complex way of asking a question but it makes them think more and leads to good discussion and a good follow up. It good to understand where someone thinks they are. The most important part though is the follow up.

#### And where would you like to be?

Are they happy where they are? Where do they want to move. This is so important as people arent static and you are hiring a team member.

Ive learned here that the software engineer i was hiring REALLY wanted to be a data scientist. This is great - but not when I really needed a software engineer long term and was already over resourced on data science.

I've also learned that a data scientist wanted to get strong at analytics or machine learning, and can contrast that to where i know current team members are learning.

##  Leadership questions

For hiring team leads / heads of. A lot of these are testing culture and values. But also experience, they should have views. The "right" answer depends on your company, but its more about the why than the answer. e.g. I do 1-1s and retrospectives should be followed up with why. There are good and ad reasons to to this. 

### How do you currently run your team? What processes do you value? ★

Tests alignment to current process but im mostly interested in reasoning. Do you have process for the sake of process or does it have a reason? Why do you not do standups anymore? Did it fix a problem did it cause a problem? what do you do instead? Are they flexible? do they adpat process to curcumstances or their way or the highway?

### What process do you do with team members? E.g. 1-1, reviews

As above but a focused variation.

### How do you think a data science team should be structured? With engineering and others?

There are million ways to structure teams and they have pros and cons. Have they even thought about this? They should have views because they should be constantly solving cross team problems.

### How should product and DS work together?

Similar to above but I think data teams particularly in startups are very used to doing a lot of their own product work. Again more about their reasoning than one way or the other.

### How much ownership should DS have over its products in production?

We have a strong culture of you build it you run it. We also don't have a team to hand things over to so you need to be able to operate indepedently. So this kind of has a right answer but its not pass / fail. If it differs ask why, tell them we do it this way and ask what they think. Maybe they love the idea? Maybe they have concerns you can talk about.

## Closing questions

These can be at the end of an interview but most are tailored to be at the end of the process. I ask these in the final hiring manager interview. This interview is normally short (30m) and focused on selling the job and answering further questions. 

### What is one of your strengths that you haven’t had the opportunity to demonstrate to us in this process yet? ★★

I ask this in the final "closer" interview when hiring. It has a few goals:

1. Lets you know something about the candidate that may be highly relevant to the role that you missed.
2. Highlights this gap in your interview process so you can fix it.
3. Shows you care about the candidate and allows them to show themselves in the best light. A positive indication of your culture.

### If we made you an offer, for what reasons would you turn it down? ★★★

This is one of my favourite questions to ask a candidate in an interview as it's so simple but can be the difference in losing or securing a candidate. I ask it near the end of the process when we are likely to make an offer. After taking some time to think, most candidates normally resort to being very direct and just telling you what's on their mind.

💬 “The title is the same that I currently have and I'm worried about stagnation, can we change it to X?”
💬 “I'm concerned about the Glassdoor reviews that mention Y.”
💬 “As I mentioned I'm moving to Spain so I'm prioritising a company that can help make that easier.”
💬 “I'm worried about the finances of a startup and thinking about whether I value stability more right now.”
💬 “Nothing, I loved the process and meeting everyone and would love to join”
💬 “I’m really looking to grow into Z role and looking for somewhere where that's a potential option.”

You have the opportunity at that moment to address the issues that may cost you the candidate. Normally the solutions to what's asked are small - an explanation to clear up a misconception, some more detail, or a small change in the offer. But it can make all the difference, and you may never have known otherwise. 

I'm going to be sharing one of my favourite interview questions each day this week so stay tuned and follow for more. What are your favourite interview questions?
