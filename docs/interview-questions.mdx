# Interview Questions

<img src={FeatureImg} width="400"/>

This is my list of interview questions you can ask candidates in your hiring process. 

Note that this doesn't show my full interview process, more on that another time.

I have added commentary to help you understand my thoughts on them, what they are trying to achieve, and how well they work. While the wording of questions is often deliberate, I don't always strictly adhere to it.

I have given my indication of how much I like a question with stars ★ from 0-3. I don't list bad questions here (unless they are untested and I'm not sure yet), so even 0 stars is good.

## Introduction / phone screen Questions

### Based on your own research and previous conversations can you tell me what you think [Company] does? ★

Have they researched the company at all? Even spent 5 minutes on the website? I want people who care about the role. they dont have to be the companies main evalngelist but they should have spent some time looking into the job they will spend the majortiy of their waking time at.

### What was interesting at [Company] and the job? ★

Better variation on why they want this job. Generally I mostly want enthusiasm for the role, it should match what they are looking for and how they want to progress. The values and ways of working we demonstrated in the job ad should be attractive. Enthusiam for the company mission is always good, ut company dependent how much that matters.

### What did you do to prepare for this interview?

Personally I dont use this. But can be a chance for candidates to show they care. I prefer the two above.

### Why are you looking to leave your current role?

Standard questions. You are looking for red flags and that their goals align with what you can offer. For example if they were applying for a manager role but looking for an opportunity to be a C level within 2 years and this is very unlikely to be available at your company, then you should know that and you should let them know that (this has happened!).

### Can you give me a 5 minute summary of your work experience to date?

Whilst their CV should have most of this, having them explain it leader to much more natural conversation. 5 minutes is a good time. You should cut them off if they go too much over.

## Testing competence

Questions in this section are mutli-part. As follow ups are essential. Competence is about deep understanding. Bad competence questions allow candidates to sail through with surface knowledge. 

### What project have you worked on that you're most proud of and why? ★★

The question is a setup. We choose proud of as they should have had deep involvement, and still remember the details. The importance of the question however is in the follow ups

{/* see advice on rebel / previous posts */}

#### Why did you use X method?

#### How does X method work?

#### What lessons did you learn from this project, is there anything you would do differently in future?

#### Speed of work vs quality, in a spectrum, where do you like to be?

Either extreme is generally bad but im looking for rather than a rigid view there view is fleixble and dependent on circumstances. 

### Case study?

maye for another time? or link to it? I think it should be mentioned

## Cultural fit

### What ceremonies and processes does your team do, which do you value or not?

The reasons are what your looking for. I really value retrospectives and I've had good candidates say they didn't. When i asked why they explained how their current company runs them and the issues - they have terrible retrospectives! They showed cultral fit in their reasoning by showing what they valued, not the initial answer.

### How would you interview [the role you are applying for]? What would be important for you?

### Team sizes?

### What is your preferred working style? How do you prefer to be managed?

### What are you looking for in a role?

## Skills fit

### Types of data scientists, what are you? ★

{/* add image of pyramid */}

"If you imagine a pyramid with the top corner being data analytics, the bottom left data engineeering and the bottom right machine learning, where would you place yourself?" For an example if you are just interested in machine learning you'd be right in the corner, or you could be halfway between two."

This sounds like a complex way of asking a question but it makes them think more and leads to good discussion and a good follow up. It good to understand where someone thinks they are. The most important part though is the follow up.

#### And where would you like to be?

Are they happy where they are? Where do they want to move. This is so important as people arent static and you are hiring a team member.

Ive learned here that the software engineer i was hiring REALLY wanted to be a data scientist. This is great - but not when I really needed a software engineer long term and was already over resourced on data science.

I've also learned that a data scientist wanted to get strong at analytics or machine learning, and can contrast that to where i know current team members are learning.

##  Leadership questions

For hiring team leads / heads of.

### How do you currently run your team? What processes do you value?


### What process do you do with team members? E.g. 1-1, reviews


### How do you think a data science team should be structured? With engineering and others?


### How much ownership should DS have over its products in production?


### How should product and DS work together?

## Closing questions

These can be at the end of an interview but most are tailored to be at the end of the process. I ask these in the final hiring manager interview. This interview is normally short (30m) and focused on selling the job and answering further questions. 

### What is one of your strengths that you haven’t had the opportunity to demonstrate to us in this process yet? ★★

### If we made you an offer, for what reasons would you turn it down? ★★★
