Hi MAC and Troy,

Further to my conversation with MAC yesterday I was asked to send through what my voluntary redundancy would look like. 

I have enjoyed my time at Boclips and believe we have accomplished a lot with some promising products and outlook, but three rounds of redundancies makes boclips a much smaller company, not secure and with significant changes to my role that is not inline with what I am looking for. I genuinely believe my role doesnâ€™t make sense for the company at this size. When I accepted this position I was managing 3 departments of 20 people.

As I discussed with Troy, Vera and Gordon on 25th November when I was informed of the redundancies of the 26th I think it makes sense for the company to make me redundant because I'm not needed at this size. It leaves us very top heavy with three managers in product development for just two team members. My advice was to keep at least one of the engineers that were let go and use the savings from my salary to pay for it along with pay increases for the other two team members (Ed and Elena) as an incentive for them and still having money saved. Otherwise, my role essentially becomes an individual contributor which I am not looking for professionally and from your perspective is vastly overpaying for a role.

My proposal for my voluntary redundancy is:

I continue working full time until the end of Jan to allow enough time for handover and closing out of my responsibilities
The remainder of my notice period (assuming the start of today) would take me to March 11th would be gardening leave
1 month of additional redundancy pay
I am able to keep my equipment (laptop, monitor etc) as an additional part of redundancy pay

Under UK law the additional redundancy pay is tax free whereas notice is not so this is a crucial component for me being able to move on with security and with a narrative that makes sense to both of us.

As a reminder the precedent of previous redundancies at Boclips has been to serve none of the notice period and with a higher redundancy payment than I'm proposing for my tenure. This has been particularly true for those in the senior team who have had significantly higher offers. I also opted for and was denied voluntary redundancy in the last redundancy in March 2024. The precedent set by that for my tenure would mean paid notice without serving + 7 weeks redundancy.

I think this is very fair and in the best interest of Boclips to allow a productive transition period and to be able to plan for 2025 with certainty about my role. And the best interests of myself being able to move on and look for a new position with security.

I have been asked what's needed for me to handover:


Ideally I would finish the work on the data pipeline and migration to sigma though I could hand this over to be completed by someone else
I have deep knowledge about parts of the data science stack that needs to be handed over to Elena as the redundancy in this knowledge was lost in previous rounds
Elena was a key part of the development and deployment of highlights so knowledge is retained there
Louanne would like me to complete the r&d claim for 23 & 24 which I am best placed to do and would bring money into the business
David would like me to help him prepare for his Nelson meeting in January

Jen and Harsha are already fully managing product and engineering so very minimal handover is needed.

Thanks

Ryan
